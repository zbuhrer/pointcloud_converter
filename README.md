Video to Point Cloud Converter
==============================

Convert videos into 3D point clouds using COLMAP.

This project extracts frames from a video, runs COLMAP to create a point cloud, and saves it in PLY format. The resulting point cloud can be imported into anything you need for visualization and further manipulation.
